# Voucherify POS
[Voucherify POS](https://voucherify-pot-pos-9defbe226ae2.herokuapp.com/) is a "point of sales" store that is integrated with the Voucherify platform, enabling the management of loyalty campaigns by purchasing products or scanning loyalty cards.

## Functionalities
### Simplified user registration
The store enables simplified user registration, which involves creating a customer by telephone number. This action allows you to collect loyalty points on a specific user's card, which can then be used in the [Voucherify app](https://voucherify-pot-mobile-35601287c1ae.herokuapp.com/) after full registration. A user who has completed full registration is recognized by the `registered_customer` metadata, which is included in the customer metadata.

### Selecting/enabling specific campaign
We can select one of two available loyalty campaigns. After selecting a specific campaign, it will be enabled and disabling the other campaign.

### Loyalty card management
The application presents a list of loyalty cards of all users, which allows you to scan and add points to a specific loyalty card.

### Selecting a location
The store allows you to choose one of several available locations. Currently, locations are hardcoded in the application.

### Product management
Products are downloaded directly from your Voucherify account, which means the product list is dynamic and includes different categories. It is also possible to add new products, which will automatically be synchronized with your Voucherify account. Products are based on the "category" metadata, products without a category are filtered out.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Product photos should contain the URL of the Voucherify domain `voucherify-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com`, otherwise the photos will not be displayed correctly or an error may occur due to an unverified domain.**

### Generating a receipt
After purchasing selected products, the store generates a receipt that contains information about the purchased products, location with address, price and payment status. 

## External tools
### Segment
[Segment](https://www.voucherify.io/integrations/segment) is a tool that we integrate with our application to effectively manage user data and the purchasing process. Thanks to the Segment, we can send data from the Voucherify and POS applications to one central place, where they are processed and further transferred to the Voucherify platform. One of many events is user verification.

## Deployment / Installation

There are multiple methods of running and deploying Composable UI.

Be sure to read the documentation on Composable UI's [environment variables](https://docs.composable.com/docs/essentials/configuration). When deploying to a cloud provider like Vercel or Netlify you must set the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` environment variable. For more information on Composable UI environment variables, see the [Application Configuration](../essentials/configuration.md) section. See these links on how to set environment variables for [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/overview/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables).

  - [Option 1: Run in Localhost](#option-1-run-in-localhost)
  - [Option 2: 1-Click Deployment ](#option-2-1-click-deployments)
  - [Option 3: Run in Docker](#option-3-run-in-docker)

You can host Composable UI on any service that supports Next.js.

After installing Composable UI, we recommend also taking a few moments to configure Algolia and Stripe to take full advantage of Composable UI's base features.

###  Option 1: Run in Localhost

To run locally, ensure that you have installed:

- Node.js v16.18.0 or higher
- pnpm v8.0 or higher

For more information about the installation, see the [Installation page](https://docs.composable.com/docs/getting_started/installation) section.

Perform the following operations in your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/composable-com/composable-ui
cd composable-ui
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

You should now have the Composable UI application running locally. Go to your web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000>

### Option 2: 1-Click Deployments

Refer to the [1-Click deployment documentation](https://docs.composable.com/docs/build_and_deploy/deploy#deploy-composable-ui) to quickly and easily deploy Composable UI to a frontend cloud provider.


### Option 3: Run in Docker

You can also run the Composable UI app easily using Docker and not worry about local dependencies. If you don't already have Docker installed, first [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) before proceeding below.

Clone, build and run the Docker image:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/composable-com/composable-ui
cd composable-ui
docker-compose up --build
```

You should now have the Composable UI application running through Docker. Go to your web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000>

## Configuring Algolia

In order to take full advantage of Composable UI, you must configure Algolia and Stripe. If you do not, the Product Listing Page (PLP) and Checkout pages will not function correctly.

### Algolia Setup

You can use Algolia's free tier to get started.

[Follow the instructions](https://docs.composable.com/docs/integrations/search/algolia) in the documentation to configure Algolia.

<!--
## Storybook Installation

Storybook is provided with a set of pre-built components to jumpstart your composable commerce project.

You can view the Storybook by running the following in terminal:

```sh
cd composable-ui/storybook
pnpm build
pnpm storybook
```

You should now have the Storybook application running locally. Go to your web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:6006>
